Mopidy-Podcast is a Mopidy_ extension for browsing and playing
podcasts.

This extension lets you browse podcasts distributed as RSS feeds and
play individual episodes in a variety of audio formats.  Podcasts are
mapped to albums, while podcast episodes are shown as tracks in
Mopidy, with metadata converted to Mopidyâ€™s native data model where
applicable.  OPML 2.0 subscription lists and directories are also
supported for multi-level browsing.

For more information and installation instructions, please see
Mopidy-Podcast's online documentation_.
